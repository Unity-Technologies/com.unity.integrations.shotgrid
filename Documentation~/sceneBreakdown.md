# Updating Assets with the Scene Breakdown Tool

The Scene Breakdown app gives a quick overview of all the assets that have been loaded into your Unity project from the Shotgrid Loader.
Assets shown with a small "x" to the left have newer versions available on Shotgrid. Assets with a green checkmark are up to date with the latest version in Shotgrid.

Once all assets to update have been selected, click "Update Selected" in the bottom right corner of the window in order to update the assets in the project and in the current scene.
