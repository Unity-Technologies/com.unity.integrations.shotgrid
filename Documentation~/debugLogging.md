# Debug Logging

When debug logging is enabled, the Shotgrid Integration provides detailed log messages that are displayed in the Unity Console, and also written to the following files:

* tk-unity.log
* tk-desktop.log
* tk-shotgrid.log

The location of these log files can be opened by selecting the Shotgrid > Project [Shotgrid Project] > Open Log Folder menu item.

These logs are especially useful for diagnosing or debugging any problems encountered with the integration.

If you would like to disable the log messages, select Shotgrid > Project [Shotgrid Project] > Toggle Debug Logging.
