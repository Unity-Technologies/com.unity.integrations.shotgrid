# Updating Assets with the Scene Breakdown Tool

The Scene Breakdown app gives a quick overview of all the assets that have been loaded into your Unity project from the Shotgun Loader.
Assets shown with a small "x" to the left have newer versions available on Shotgun. Assets with a green checkmark are up to date with the latest version in Shotgun.
