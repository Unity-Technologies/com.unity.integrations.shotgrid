# Debug Logging

When debug logging is enabled, the Shotgun Integration provides detailed log messages that are displayed in the Unity Console, and also written to the following files:

* tk-unity.log
* tk-desktop.log
* tk-shotgun.log

The location of these log files can be opened by selecting the Shotgun > Project [Shotgun Project] > Open Log Folder menu item.

These logs are especially useful for diagnosing or debugging any problems encountered with the integration.

If you would like to disable the log messages, select Shotgun > Project [Shotgun Project] > Toggle Debug Logging.
